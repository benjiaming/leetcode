Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Runs in O(n)

        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]

        storage = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):

            if index is not None and index != i:
                return [index, i]
            storage[nums[i]] = i
